                            module which allows Investors to have their accounts managed by a trader appointed by
                            them on the basis of a limited trading power of attorney. This technical solution allows
                            the Master trader on one trading platform to manage simultaneously unlimited quantity of
                            Investor managed accounts.

                            Depending on the size of the deposit each Investor`s managed account has its own ratio
                            in all pool. Total sum of all ratios under one pool is always equal to 100%. Trader's
                            activity results (trades, Profit & Loss) are allocated between Investor`s managed
                            accounts according to ratio.

                                is that you need to understand the risk. If the Master Trader loses money, so do
                                you. He or she cannot be held responsible because technically, you chose to appoint
                                a trader on the account.her.
